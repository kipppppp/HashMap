<h1>Custom HashMap</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project implements a functional custom HashMap class that allows a user to store key/value pairs. The underlying data structure is a custom DynamicArray class that has similar functionality to a built-in Python list.
The first file (SC) implements Linked List chaining to manage hash collisions, while the second (OA) utilizes open addressing and quadratic probing. The third file contains provided data structures, and the 
fourth file implements basic testing using pytest.
